Following the [intro to ML course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) from kaggle and learning about interfacing with kaggle in general. 

I have used the standard kaggle API to pull the source files of the course and its data since I found it easier and faster to experiment locally with the course contents. In particular, one can do the experiments offline and with larger CPU / GPU power available than on the kaggle cloud. Furthermore, I can organize the files as I would like to and go through each lecture actively and not passively, i.e. restructuring the code and really going through every line of the code itself instead of just reading through the tutorial.

### Additional lib equirements

Beside the usual pip libraries, one needs to also install the kaggle's `learntools`
